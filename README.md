2.  Navigate into the directory: `cd sentiric-stt-service`
3.  Create a virtual environment and install dependencies: `python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt`
4.  Create a `.env` file from `.env.example` (if any).
5.  Start the service: `python app.py` (or equivalent).

**Configuration:**
Refer to `config/` directory and `.env.example` for service-specific configurations.
